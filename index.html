                I brought EdEx in 2012 when we had an influx of students due to
                some restructuring of the neighborhood. Our teachers rarely
                worked with such a diverse group of students, and didn’t really
                know how to effectively reach students. EdEx really help with
                providing a framework and restructuring the curriculum to be
                more diverse and inclusive of a diverse student body, and
                overall it has helped improved our culture significantly.

                I really liked the space EdEx provided for us [students] to have
                conversation with our teachers in a same space with some of the
                things they do that makes me feel bad. I also think them
                implementing the Bias Hotline is really helpful because
                sometimes things happen and someone might be uncomfortable with
                going to an administrator.

                It's really important to have these conversations of diversity
                and equity within the schools. We see our students everyday, and
                we need to think about the situations our students face everyday
                and aim to delibertly fight against issues of systematic racism
                and justice.

                We've never had a school send out a community and diversity
                assessment before. I think EdEx has really reformed the way the
                school interacts with the parents and that has really reinformed
                the education of the students.

                I think what EdEx has helped our team realize is the diferences
                between equity and how that translates within the classroom,
                classroom materials, our general expectations for students and
                teachers. I know through creating space and making space, we're
                now able to have more conversation regarding facilitating an
                inclusive and safe space for our students and within the
                materials they use to learn.
